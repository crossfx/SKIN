# How to use #
All you have to do is open the *Gamepad Viewer* link in your browser when your PS4 controller is connected. Now you can
include the browser window with OBS to display your inputs in real-time.


# Notes #
- special thanks to jayraydee from the gamepad viewer discord server for the support with the github issue
- the skins were re-colored by vysualstv, not by me
